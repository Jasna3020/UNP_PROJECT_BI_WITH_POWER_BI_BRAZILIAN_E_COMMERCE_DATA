# UNP_BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE_DATA
I have done a project which analyzes Brazilian E-Commerce data, tracking transactions to uncover insights. Findings show rising orders, revenue concentration in key states, and high freight costs. Recommendations include flexible payments, localized marketing, loyalty programs, and supply chain optimizations to boost growth and efficiency.
